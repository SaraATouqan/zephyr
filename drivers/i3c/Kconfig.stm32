      Configures the heap size for dynamically allocating the regions for
      storing status FIFO and control FIFO words which will be used by the DMA.
      This value depends on the maximum number of messages that will be sent
      during a single transfer. 2KB guarantees enough heap size for sending 256
      messages on a single transfer.
